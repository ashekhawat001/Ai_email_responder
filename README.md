## Personalized Customer Support Emails with Bard

This project utilizes Bard, a large language model, to automate draft generation and send replies for personalized customer support emails. 

### Project Goal

**Achieved!** The project automates draft generation and **sends replies** for personalized customer support emails, improving efficiency. 

### Functionality

1. **Customer Inquiry Capture (Implemented):** The system captures relevant details from a customer inquiry received through email using the Gmail API. This might include:
    * Category (e.g., billing issue, product question)
    * Keywords extracted from the email content
    * Customer information (optional)
2. **Bard Integration (Implemented):** The captured data points are used to prompt Bard to generate a draft email response.
3. **Automated Sending (Implemented):** The script **automatically sends the generated draft email as a reply** to the customer inquiry.
    * **Human Review (Optional):** The project can be further extended to include a human review step before sending the reply 

### Benefits

* **Increased Efficiency:** Automating draft generation and sending replies significantly saves time for customer support teams.
* **Improved Customer Satisfaction:** Personalized responses enhance the customer experience.
* **Faster Resolution Times:** By offering solutions or outlining next steps promptly, inquiries can be addressed more efficiently.

### Implementation Details

**Email System Integration :**

* The Gmail API is used to access and retrieve emails from your Gmail account.
* The script extracts relevant details from new emails (subject line, body text, sender information).
* Extracted text data undergoes basic cleaning (removing unnecessary characters, converting to lowercase) and keyword extraction.

**Bard Integration:**

* Bard's API is used to generate draft email responses based on the captured data points (category, keywords).
* The prompt instructs Bard to create an email with acknowledgement, explanation, solution/next steps, and a personalized closing.

**Automated Reply Sending (New):**

* The script utilizes the Gmail API again to send the generated draft email as a reply to the original customer inquiry.
