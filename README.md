## Personalized Customer Support Emails with Bard

This project utilizes Bard, a large language model, to automate draft generation and send replies for personalized customer support emails. 

### Project Goal

**Achieved!** The project automates draft generation and **sends replies** for personalized customer support emails, improving efficiency. 

### Functionality

1. **Customer Inquiry Capture (Implemented):** The system captures relevant details from a customer inquiry received through email using the Gmail API. This might include:
    * Category (e.g., billing issue, product question)
    * Keywords extracted from the email content
    * Customer information (optional)
2. **Bard Integration (Implemented):** The captured data points are used to prompt Bard to generate a draft email response.
3. **Automated Sending (Implemented):** The script **automatically sends the generated draft email as a reply** to the customer inquiry.
    * **Human Review (Optional):** The project can be further extended to include a human review step before sending the reply 
### Benefits

* **Increased Efficiency:** Automating draft generation and sending replies significantly saves time for customer support teams.
* **Improved Customer Satisfaction:** Personalized responses enhance the customer experience.
* **Faster Resolution Times:** By offering solutions or outlining next steps promptly, inquiries can be addressed more efficiently.

**Technologies:**

* Bard (Large Language Model)
* Gmail API (for email access)
* Python (programming language)
  * `os`
  * `simplegmail`
  * `google.generativeai`  (assuming Bard integration library)
  * `dotenv`

**Prerequisites:**

* A Gmail account with access to the Gmail API.
* A Bard project and API credentials (if Bard requires them).
### Implementation Details

**Email System Integration :**

* The Gmail API is used to access and retrieve emails from your Gmail account.
* The script extracts relevant details from new emails (subject line, body text, sender information).
* Extracted text data undergoes basic cleaning (removing unnecessary characters, converting to lowercase) and keyword extraction.

**Bard Integration:**

* Bard's API is used to generate draft email responses based on the captured data points (category, keywords).
* The prompt instructs Bard to create an email with acknowledgement, explanation, solution/next steps, and a personalized closing.

**Automated Reply Sending (New):**

* The script utilizes the Gmail API again to send the generated draft email as a reply to the original customer inquiry.

**Setup Instructions:**

1. **Create a `.env` file** in your project's root directory. This file will securely store your API keys. Here's an example structure:

   ```
   BARD_API_KEY=<your_bard_api_key>  # Replace with your Bard API key (if applicable)
   ```

2. **Download Gmail API Client Secret JSON:**

   - Visit the Google Cloud Console: [https://console.cloud.google.com/](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Create a new project (or select an existing one).
   - Enable the Gmail API for your project.
   - Create OAuth client credentials (choose "Desktop app" or "Web app" depending on your application type).
   - Download the JSON file containing your client secret.
   - Place this file in your project directory and update the path in the `.env` file accordingly.

3. **Install Required Libraries:**

   Open a terminal or command prompt in your project directory and run the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install os simplegmail google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 google-api-python-client dotenv
   ```
**Running the App:**

1. **Ensure you're logged in to the correct Gmail account** in your web browser (the one you want the script to access).



2. **Run the script:**

   Execute your main Python script (e.g., `read.py`) from the terminal:

   ```bash
   python read.py
   ```

**Important Notes:**

* **Security:** Never share your API keys publicly. The `.env` file helps keep them private. Consider using a more robust environment variable management solution in production environments.
* **Human Review:** While automated replies can be helpful, consider incorporating a human review step before sending responses to ensure accuracy and maintain a high level of customer service.
* **Customization:** You'll need to replace placeholders like `<path/to/client_secret.json>` and `<your_bard_api_key>` with your actual values.
